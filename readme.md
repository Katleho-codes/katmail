# Setting or testing with gmail

## ✅ Step 1: Enable Gmail Access for Nodemailer

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security.
1. Enable 2-Step Verification (if not already).
1. After enabling, go to App Passwords.
1. Choose "Mail" and "Other" (type: Nodemailer), and generate.
1. Copy the 16-character password — this is what you’ll use in Nodemailer.

## ✅ Step 2: Basic Nodemailer Setup with Gmail

`npm install nodemailer`

```js
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: "gmail",
    auth: {
        user: "your-email@gmail.com",
        pass: "your-app-password", // Use app password here
    },
});

const mailOptions = {
    from: "your-email@gmail.com",
    to: "recipient@example.com",
    subject: "Test Email from Nodemailer",
    text: "This is a test email using Gmail + Nodemailer!",
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        return console.log("Error:", error);
    }
    console.log("Email sent:", info.response);
});
```
### ✅ Core Email Sending

- [ ] Set up basic Nodemailer transport
- [ ] Allow environment-based SMTP config (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
- [ ] Implement simple POST `/send-email` endpoint
- [ ] Validate email input (to, subject, body)
- [ ] Support plain text and HTML emails

---

### 🧩 Templates & Content

- [ ] Create reusable templates (welcome, reset password, etc.)
- [ ] Add template engine support (e.g., Handlebars or EJS)
- [ ] Enable dynamic variables in templates
- [ ] Allow switching templates via API

---

### 📊 Logging & Tracking

- [ ] Log sent emails (to, status, timestamp)
- [ ] Store logs in a database (SQLite/Postgres)
- [ ] Track delivery success/failure
- [ ] Add unique email IDs for traceability

---

### ♻️ Reliability

- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed sends
- [ ] Add timeout and error handling
- [ ] Queue emails (optional: in-memory or Redis)

---

### 🖥️ Dashboard (Optional UI)

- [ ] Build simple dashboard to view email logs
- [ ] Filter by status, email address, template
- [ ] View email preview and metadata

---

### 🔐 Security

- [ ] Protect email sending endpoint (e.g., API key auth)
- [ ] Rate limit email requests
- [ ] Sanitize inputs to prevent injection

---

### 🤖 Developer Experience

- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Create Postman collection or cURL examples
- [ ] Copilot/codegen-friendly function names and types
- [ ] README with install/setup instructions

---

### 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Test email sending via Gmail
- [ ] Add mock transport for local testing
- [ ] Write integration tests for endpoints

---

### 🚀 Deployment

- [ ] Dockerize the app
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku/Vercel/Fly.io
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.)
